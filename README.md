# Android_App
Making a food restaurant using Android Studio - Java and the local SQLite database.

A lot of time and effort was spent on this project,
but every day I got better and better, I learned a lot in android studio.

I think so far I have a fully working app that always has more to add.
Something I can add soon is the favorites-fragment and its view and adapter. 
Then saving favourite products for each user in the database.
